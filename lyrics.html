            I said, you're one and only
            You said, you're perfect for me
            Would you like anything to drink?
            Well that's nice of you
            I said, I'm insecure, but
            I'll take a glass of water
            And you gave me the seven seas

            And baby we have a ways to go
            But water makes for waterfalls, which tend to overflow
            And baby you give me strength and hope
            And you just need to know
            I love you

            All alone in an ocean
            Feel my soul, pure devotion
            Darlin' you're the only one that takes my breath away
            All these waves pull me under
            And just like rain before the thunder
            Love can get much deeper than it seems
            Much deeper than it

            You said, I know we're getting close
            But I think we should take it slow
            I said, I'm here for you no matter what we do
            Now you're the tune of everything
            We put our love in candy rings
            And all our seas have turned from grey to baby blue

            But love gets deeper
            And candy sweeter
            Hear the echoes of love believers
            And this whole boat could sink tonight, but I'll go
            With all your wishes
            And all my kisses
            All our troubles are nonexistent
            We never thought that we'd be here, but I know

            Baby we have a ways to go
            But water makes for waterfalls, which tend to overflow
            And baby you give me strength and hope
            And you just need to know
            I love you

            All alone in an ocean
            Feel my soul, pure devotion
            Darlin' you're the only one that takes my breath away
            All these waves pull me under
            And just like rain before the thunder
            Love can get much deeper than it seems
            Much deeper than it seems

            Oh woah, oh woah
            Love can get much deeper than it seems
            Oh woah, oh woah
            Love can get much deeper than it
